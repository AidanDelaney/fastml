# Gubbins FastML changes #

This repository provides some additional functionality to fastml to allow it to work with Gubbins.
The original code is available from http://fastml.tau.ac.il/source.html and should be your first port of call.

# Changelog (ish) #

We're working on tarball source relases from upstream.  As such it is difficult to maintain a sensible change history over time.  Essentially, we have a set of source changes (that can't be represented as a clean patch) that are applied to each release of FastML.

Aidan Delaney Tue Apr 08 2014
 * Partial port of v2.02 changes to v3.1.

Andrew Page Fri Sep 28 2012
 * Initial source changes on top of version 2.02.
